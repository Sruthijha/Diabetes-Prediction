A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on health data.  
Built using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** and trained with multiple classifiers, with **LightGBM** chosen as the final model.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, imputing, scaling where needed).  
- Trained & compared **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, **AdaBoost**, and **LightGBM**.  
- Evaluated with **Accuracy, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC** (focus on Recall due to medical context).  
- Final model: **LightGBM (Accuracy ~78%, Recall ~67%)**.  
- Prediction function returns both **class (0/1)** and **probability of diabetes**.  
- Interactive **Streamlit web app** for user-friendly predictions.
